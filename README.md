# Profile Generator
    This project involved using API calls to Github to make a PDF profile from a GitHub username. 
The user is prompted with a couple questions, so a PDF profile can be populated. The PDF contains the
following: User name, image, bio, repositories, followers, stars, and users followings. There were also 
links to location, profile, and users blog.
